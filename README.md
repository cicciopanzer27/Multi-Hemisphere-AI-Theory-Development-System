# Multi-Hemisphere-AI-Theory-Development-System
Advanced multi-hemisphere AI system for developing complex scientific theories, with particular focus on the "Theory of Everything" in physics. The project implements a neural architecture inspired by the human brain that combines specialized hemispheres for logical analysis, creative intuition, mathematical processing, and experimental validation.
